# Preprocessing of Histopathology Images

Histopathology refers to microscopic examination of tissue for predicting disease. Digital Hist opathology provie tools to examine the digitized specimen slides through virtual microscopy. Glass slides are converted into digital slides and  can be viewed, managed, shared and analyzed computationally. Digital pathology is widely being used in diagnostic medicine where deep learning based models may be used for efficient and cheaper diagnoses, prognosis, and prediction of diseases.

Digita pathology Images are often larger with higher resolution, thus handling them for analysis through visualization or preparing for training supervised deep models is require. 
This repository preprocessed large image files to create a dataset of crops/patches of image.
